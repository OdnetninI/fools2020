<h1>Fools2020... or not?</h1>

<p>I'm sorry to say that <b>despite my best efforts, I was not able to finish and release Fools2020 in time</b>. Many things have contributed to this state of affairs - busy schedule, overall shortage of development time and resources, organizational problems, big changes in life and mental health issues, and the final nail in the coffin: the recent COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>Because of the unstable development cycle and volatile requirements, the project has become a hard to maintain mess of spaghetti code. Everything is still heavily unfinished and hardly working, and many things would have to be redone from scratch.</p>

<p>However, it would be a huge waste to just throw everything away. I decided to <b>release whatever I was able to make</b>, completed or not, so the community can still have fun together. Everything is uploaded in raw form, with everything uncut.</p>

<p>Try to compile and see things running. Look for unused stuff. Imagine what the project could have been. Look through the source, insert some <i>NotLikeThis</i> comments. Investigate everything. Or even finish what I started. Maybe some day I will be able to see Fools2020 not as the creator, but as a participant.</p>
